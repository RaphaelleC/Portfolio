          <h5>General Assembly (March 2021 - June 2021)</h5>
          <p className="fs-5">This thirteen-week course has been one of the most rewarding and intense adventure I have experienced so far. Taught by industry professionals, it covered the fundamentals of web development through lessons, as well as individual and group projects. We had daily stand ups to discuss blockers and issues, share knowledge and findings. I loved working in groups where we could brainstorm, be it for projects or short exercises after a lesson.</p>

          <h5>ASOS (April 2019 - January 2020)</h5>
          <p className="fs-5">Working for a famous online shopping website was a great experience. I was answering customer queries through multiple channel (live chat, Facebook, Twitter and email), which challenged me as I often had to converse with multiple customers at a time, while following the company&apos;s chart. I was working with a wonderful, supportive and helpful team that always encouraged me and gave me the best advice.</p>
